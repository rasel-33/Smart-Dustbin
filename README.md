# Smart-Dustbin
# Microcontroller Dustbin Opener Project

## Overview

This project involves using a microcontroller to control the opening mechanism of a dustbin based on input from an ultrasonic sensor. The system detects the proximity of an object (such as a hand or trash) using the ultrasonic sensor and triggers the dustbin lid to open automatically.

## Hardware Requirements

- Microcontroller (Arduino nano)
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Servo Motor or DC Motor for the lid mechanism
- Power Supply
- Connecting wires
- Dustbin with lid mechanism (if not already available)

## Wiring

- Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the microcontroller.
- Connect the servo or DC motor to the microcontroller for controlling the lid.
- Ensure proper power supply for both the microcontroller and the motor.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone or download the project repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rasel-33/Smart-Dustbin.git

```
# Future Work
The project can be exteded to get a mobile notification when a certain limit of garbage is collected.
